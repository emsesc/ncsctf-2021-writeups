## FM03 Hint
During the competition, the following hint was emailed out:

> **Hint:** It's a Veracrypt encrypted volume ðŸ¤”

## Solution
The file containing `dir_volume` can be found [here](https://github.com/Alic3C/Cyber-FastTrack-Spring-2021/blob/main/Forensics/FM03/fm03.zip).

With some research, we find that it *is* possible to recover a Veracrypt Encrypted volume even if you don't know the password. **Brute force [with `hashcat`](https://linuxhint.com/get_data_encrypted_drive/)!**

For reference, here are some modes `hashcat` provides. (Use `hashcat -h` to print them out)

`sudo hashcat -a 0 -m 13722 dirvolume /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --force`

Eventually, you're able to crack the hash with the password: `redwings`.

Download *Veracrypt* to decrypt your volume using the brute-force obtained password. The files should be extracted to a directory, which contains a "Flag" folder and `flag.txt`.

## Flag
Flag: `Us3_5tr0ng_P@55w0Rds!`
