## Briefing
> Download the [file](https://github.com/Alic3C/Cyber-FastTrack-Spring-2021/blob/main/Forensics/FE04/fe04.zip) and filter down to the username according to criteria below.

> The username you are looking for has `x` as the 3rd character, followed immediately by a number from `2` to `6`, it has a `Z` character in it and the last character is `S`.

> When you have the username, submit it as the flag.

## Solution
**What the username needs to fulfill:**
* `x` as 3rd character
* 4th character in the range of `2` to `6`
* Contains `Z`
* Last character is `S`

This can be completed with `grep`, `regex`, and probably other solutions as well. I decided to write a `python` script to do the trick!

```python
with open("list.txt", "r") as a_file:
# this opens the list with the 50k usernames
  array1 = ["2", "3", "4", "5", "6"]
# this is the range of numbers the 4th character can be
  for line in a_file:
    # this starts a loop to loop through the 50k usernames
    stripped_line = line.strip()
    # this strips any newlines like \n from the username 
    if stripped_line[2] == "x" and stripped_line[3] in array1 and "Z" in stripped_line and stripped_line[-1] == "S":
      # some conditionals that use indexes to filter out the username
      print("Flag: " + stripped_line)
      # let's print out the matching string!
```
Output: `Flag: YXx52hsi3ZQ5b9rS`

## Flag
Flag: `YXx52hsi3ZQ5b9rS`
