* I ended up placing 25th out of 3,277 players, which wasn't bad, considering that I expected to do worse. 
* My point values were low because I mainly targeted the "easy," "medium," and some "hard" challenges, straying away from the "extreme" category.
* Overall, pretty pleased with the outcome!

> Note: In my opinion, these "binary" challenges were not what I expected. Mostly reversing and just guessing what the service wanted??
