## Briefing
> Download the [file](https://github.com/Alic3C/Cyber-FastTrack-Spring-2021/blob/main/Binary/BE02/BE02.zip) and find a way to get the flag.

## Solution
Let's run the file first to get an idea of what it wants or does.

```bash
chmod 777 rot13
./rot13
```
```bash
===================================
ROT IN sHELL :: ROT13's your input!
===================================
> rotforlife

ROT13 output:
> ebgsbeyvsr
```
It seems to be a classic ROT13 cipher program that shifts your characters 13 across the alphabet. What if it's vulnerable to buffer overflow?

```bash
python -c 'print "A"*100' | ./rot13
```
> All this command does is pipe into the `rot13` program the letter "A" 100 times.
```bash
===================================
ROT IN sHELL :: ROT13's your input!
===================================
