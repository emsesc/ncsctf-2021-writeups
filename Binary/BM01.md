## Briefing
> Download the [file](https://github.com/Alic3C/Cyber-FastTrack-Spring-2021/blob/main/Binary/BE02/BE02.zip) and find a way to get the flag.

## Solution
Let's run the file:
```bash
chmod 777 program
./program
```
```bash
Какой пароль？
> letmein
неверный.
```
The program first asks "What is the password?" and after my response, replies with "Incorrect." The `strings` command does not leak anything, so let's head to `gdb` to debug it.

### Debugging with GDB
```bash
gdb-peda$ file program
Reading symbols from program...(no debugging symbols found)...done.
gdb-peda$ break *main
Breakpoint 1 at 0x7ca
```
Keep using the `n` command until you get to the `fgets@plt` function and put in anything you want. Then, proceed until this function.

```bash
 ► 0x55555555482f <main+101>    call   strcmp@plt <0x5555555546a0>
        s1: 0x5555555549c8 ◂— 0xbed0bbd0bed0bcd0
        s2: 0x7fffffffde50 ◂— 'password\n'
```
**The `strcmp@plt` function compares OUR input at address `0x7fffffffde50` with some string at `0x5555555549c8` to decide if it wants to let us in.**

> :bulb: The hex value `0xbed0bbd0bed0bcd0` is PART of the password in hex.

### What's the string?
Use the first command to ask gdb to display the full string, and `x/s` to display whatever it is at the address.
```bash
gdb-peda$ set print elements 0
gdb-peda$ x/s 0x5555555549c8
0x5555555549c8:	"молоток123\n"
```
**The correct password is: `молоток123`.**

### Let me in!
Exit gdb and run the program again.
```bash
./program
Какой пароль？
> молоток123
верный!

флаг: wh1te%BluE$R3d
```

## Flag
Flag: `wh1te%BluE$R3d`
