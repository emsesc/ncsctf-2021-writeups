## Briefing
> Download the [file](https://github.com/Alic3C/Cyber-FastTrack-Spring-2021/blob/main/Binary/BM02/BM02.zip) and find a way to get the flag.

## Solution
Let's run the file:
```bash
chmod 777 program
./program
```
```bash
I'm not going to make it that easy for you.
```
OK then... I guess we'll have to take a look at it's source code.

### Debugging with [Binary Ninja](https://cloud.binary.ninja/)
First we see **a function of interest:**

> :bulb: A list of functions can also be found in gdb using `info func`

`printFlag` - that might be helpful! But how can we call it?
Analyzing this interesting function in High-Level IL, we see the logic it uses:

The **code to continue running the function and print out the flag** only continues **if** the argument given to `printFlag()` equals `0x539`.

Problems:
1. The program does not call `printFlag()` anywhere.
2. The function requires a specific input of `0x539`.

### Jumping around with GDB
These problems can be solved with GDB, by using it to **[call `printFlag()`](https://bestestredteam.com/2020/05/01/calling-functions-with-gdb/) with `0x539` as the argument.**

```bash
gdb-peda$ file program
Reading symbols from program...(no debugging symbols found)...done.
gdb-peda$ break *main
Breakpoint 1 at 0x7e3
gdb-peda$ run
[insert garbage here...]
gdb-peda$ print (int) printFlag (0x539)
Flag: patchItFixIt
```

## Flag
Flag: `patchItFixIt`
