## Briefing
> Download the [file](https://github.com/Alic3C/Cyber-FastTrack-Spring-2021/blob/main/Binary/BH01/BH01.zip) and find a way to get the flag.

## Solution
When you first run the binary, it asks for "a magic word."
```bash
./program
```
```bash
What is the magic word?
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Flag: ad#����*���E	
Did you understand that?
```
> Part of the flag is printed out!

I decided to see if it would react differently if I put a different letter in.
```bash
python -c 'print "c"*100' | ./program
```
```bash
What is the magic word?
Flag: aLi#����*���E	
Did you understand that?
```
> Sure enough, it seems like more of the flag was printed out.

This python script **fuzzes the program using every printable ascii string**.
```py
from pwn import *
import string

for i in string.printable:
	p = process('program')
	print(p.recvline())
	print(i)
	p.sendline(i*100)
	print(p.recvline())
	p.clean()
```

Eventually, the character `~` printed 100 times produced the flag.
```bash
[+] Starting local process './program': pid 71143
b'What is the magic word?\n'
{
[*] Process './program' stopped with exit code 0 (pid 71143)
b'Flag: aLittLeObfuScatIonalCharAct\xba\xfc\x1a\n'
[+] Starting local process './program': pid 71145
b'What is the magic word?\n'
|
b'Flag: aLittLeObfuScatIonalCharActE\xfc\x1a\n'
[*] Process './program' stopped with exit code 0 (pid 71145)
[+] Starting local process './program': pid 71147
b'What is the magic word?\n'
}
b'Flag: aLittLeObfuScatIonalCharActEr\x1a\n'
[*] Process './program' stopped with exit code 0 (pid 71147)
[+] Starting local process './program': pid 71149
b'What is the magic word?\n'
~
[*] Process './program' stopped with exit code 0 (pid 71149)
b'Flag: aLittLeObfuScatIonalCharActEr\n'
```

# Flag
Flag: `aLittLeObfuScatIonalCharActEr`
